[C7]Backstroke lover
Always hiding 'neath the covers
"Gonna talk to you?" My daddy say
Said "You ain't seen nothing
Till you're down on a muffin and
you're sure to be achanging your ways"
I met a cheerleader
Was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
Cause the best things in loving
With a sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss

[C7]Seesaw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
I sing hey diddle diddle
With your kitty in the middle
of the swing like I didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Was a me she was fooling
Cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay
When she told me to

[C7]School girl sweetie
With the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbing way up her knee
There was three young ladies
In the school gym locker
When I noticed they was looking at me
I was a high school loser
Never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbor
With a daughter had a favor
So I gave her juast a little kiss
