Get yourself cooler, lay yourself low
Coincidental murder, with nothing to show
With the judge, constipation will go to his head
And his wife's aggravation, you're soon enough dead

Gotcha with the cocaine they found with your gun
No smoothy face lawyer to getcha undone

You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around

When you're low down and dirty, from walkin' the street
With your old hurdy-gurdy, no one to meet
Say love ain't the same, on the south side of town
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around
