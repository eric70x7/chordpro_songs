[Am7]
Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
[Dm7]
Lord I miss you
[Am7]
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
[Dm7]
When the phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say
[Am7]
Hey, what's the matter man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
[Dm7]
With some Puerto Rican girls that are just dyin' to meet you
[Am7]
We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around

I've been walking in Central Park
Singing after dark
[Dm7]
People think I'm crazy

I've been stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
[Dm7]
Asking people, what's the matter with you boy?
