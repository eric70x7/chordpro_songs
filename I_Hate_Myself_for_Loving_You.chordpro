Midnight, gettin' uptight, where are you?

You said you'd meet me, now it's quarter to two
[B]
I know I'm hangin' but I'm still wantin' you
[D5/A]         [E5]
Hey Jack, it's a fact they're talkin' in town

I turn my back and you're messin' around

But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do

I'm over being angry 'bout the hell you put me through

You just don't know what you was missin' last night

I wanna see you begging, say forget it just for spite
