[D5/A]         [E5]
Midnight, gettin' uptight, where are you?
[A]
You said you'd meet me, now it's quarter to two
[B]
I know I'm hangin' but I'm still wantin' you
[D5/A]         [E5]
Hey Jack, it's a fact they're talkin' in town
[A]
I turn my back and you're messin' around

I'm not really jealous, don't like lookin' like a clown

[D5/A]         [E5]
Daylight, spent the night without you

But I've been dreamin' 'bout the lovin' you do
[B]
I'm over being angry 'bout the hell you put me through
[D5/A]         [E5]
Hey, man, bet you can treat me right

You just don't know what you was missin' last night

I wanna see you begging, say forget it just for spite
