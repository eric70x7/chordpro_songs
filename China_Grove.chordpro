When the sun comes up on a sleepy little town

Down around San Antone
[E]
And the folks are risin' for another day
[D]       [A/C#]      [A]      [E]
'Round about their homes
[C#m]                           [B]
People of the town are strange

{sop: Verse 2}
[E]
Well, the preacher and the teacher, Lord, they're a caution
[D]            [A/C#]    [A]   [E]
They are the talk of the town
[E]
When the gossip gets to flyin' and they ain't lyin'
[D]           [A/C#]        [A]         [E]
When the sun goes fallin' down
[C#m]                              [B]
They say that the father's insane
[A]                  [A#]    [B] [C]
And dear Missus Perkin's a game

But ev'ry day there's a new thing comin'
[F#m]                 [C#m]
The ways of an oriental view
[C#m]
The sheriff and his buddies with their samurai swords
[F#]
You can even hear the music at night
[G#m] [B]
[C#m]
And though it's a part of the Lone Star State
[F#m]                       [C#m]
People don't seem to care
[A]
They just keep on lookin' to the East
