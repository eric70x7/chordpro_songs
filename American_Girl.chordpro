{sop: Verse 1}
[D]           [E7]
Well, she was an American girl
[G]         [A]
Raised on promises
[D]                 [E7]
She couldn't help thinkin' that there was a
[G]                    [A]
little more to life somewhere else
[A]                [D]
After all it was a great big world
[G]                      [Em]
With lots of places to run to
[A]
And if she had to die...tryin' she had one more promise she was gonna keep

{soc}
[G]         [A]
Oh yeah, all right
[D]                      [Bm]
take it easy, baby, make it last all night
[G]         [A]          [D]
She was an American girl

{sop: Verse 2}
[D]               [E7]
Well, it was kinda cold that night
[G]                        [A]
She stood alone on the balcony
[D]                     [E7]
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by
[G]                            [A]
Out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach
[A]                     [D]
And for one desperate moment there
[G]                  [Em]
He crept back in her memory
[A]
God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach
{eop}

{soc}
[G]         [A]
Oh yeah, all right
[D]                      [Bm]
take it easy, baby, make it last all night
[G]         [A]          [D]
She was an American girl
