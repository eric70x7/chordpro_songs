{sop: Verse 1}
[F#m]
They made up their minds
[Bm]
And they started packing
[C#7]
They left before the sun came up that day
[F#7]                   [Bm]
An exit to eternal summer slacking
[F#m]                   [C#7]
But where were they going without ever knowing the way
{eop}

{sop: Verse 2}
[F#m]
They drank up the wine
[Bm]
And they got to talking
[C#7]
They now had more important things to say
[F#7]                        [Bm]
And when the car broke down they started walking
[F#m]                   [C#7]
Where were they going without ever knowing the way

Anyone can see the road that they walk on is paved with gold
[F#m]                        [C#7]
It’s always summer. They’ll never get cold
[D]                      [A]                   [E]
They’ll never get hungry. They’ll never get old and grey
[E]           [A]                [E]
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
[F#m]                       [C#7]
They won’t make it home But they really don’t care
[D]                    [A]                 [E]
They wanted the highway They’re happier there today
[C#7]

{sop: Verse 3}
[F#m]
Their children woke up
[Bm]
And they couldn’t find them
[C#7]
They’d left before the sun came up that day
[F#7]                        [Bm]
They just drove off and left it all behind them
[F#m]                   [C#7]
But where were they going without ever knowing the way
