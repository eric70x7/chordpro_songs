[G]                [Em]
I remember the thirtyfive sweet goodbyes
[C]                      [D]
When you put me on the Wolverine
[G]
Up to Annandale
It was still September
[Em]
When your daddy was quite surprised
[C]                      [D]
To find you with the working girls
[G]
In the county jail
{eop}

{sop: Pre-Chorus}
[C]
I was smoking with the boys upstairs
[D]
When I heard about the whole affair

[Gmaj7]         [Em]
I said oh no
[Gmaj7]     [Em]     [C]
William and Mary won't do, now
[D]                [Am7]
Well I did not think the girl
[Bm7]           [Em]
Could be so cruel
[D]                [Am7]
And I'm never going back
[Bm7]           [G]
To my old school

[G]                [Em]
Oleanders growing outside her door
[C]                      [D]
Soon they're gonna be in bloom
[G]
Up in Annandale
I can't stand her
[Em]
Doing what she did before
[C]                      [D]
Living like a gypsy queen
[G]
In a fairy tale
{eop}

{sop: Pre-Chorus}
[C]
Well I hear the whistle but I can't go
[D]
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico

Well I did not think the girl

[C]                      [D]
That'll be the day I go
[G]
Back to Annandale
Tried to warn you
[Em]
About Chino and Daddy Gee
[C]                      [D]
But I can't seem to get to you
