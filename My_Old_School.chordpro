{sop: Verse 1}
[G]                                        [Em7]
I remember the thirty-five sweet goodbyes
[C]                       [D]
When you put me on the Wolverine
[G]
Up to Annandale
[G]
It was still September
[Em7]
When your daddy was quite surprised
[C]                     [D]
To find you with the working girls
[G]
In the county jail
{eop}

{sop: Pre-Chorus}
[G]     [C]
I was smoking with the boys upstairs
[D]
When I heard about the whole affair
[Gmaj7] [Em]
I said oh no

[Gmaj7]       [Em]         [C]
William and Mary won't do, now
[D]                 [Am7]
Well I did not think the girl
[Bm7] [Em]
Could be so cruel
[D]           [Am7]
And I'm never going back
[Bm7] [G]
To my old school

{sop: Verse 2}
[G]                                  [Em7]
Oleanders growing outside her door
[C]                   [D]
Soon they're gonna be in bloom
[G]
Up in Annandale
[G]
I can't stand her
[Em7]
Doing what she did before
[C]              [D]
Living like a gypsy queen
[G]
In a fairy tale
{eop}

{sop: Pre-Chorus}
[G]      [C]
Well I hear the whistle but I can't go
[D]
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico
[Gmaj7] [Em]
She said whoa no
{eop}

{soc}
[Gmaj7]  [Em]         [C]
Guadalajara won't do, now

[G]                               [Em7]
California tumbles into the sea
[C]               [D]
That'll be the day I go
[G]
Back to Annandale
[G]
Tried to warn you
[Em7]
About Chino and Daddy Gee
[C]                    [D]
But I can't seem to get to you
[G]
Through the U.S. Mail
{eop}
