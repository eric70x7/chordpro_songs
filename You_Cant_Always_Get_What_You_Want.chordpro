[E]                          [A/C#]
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would meet her connection
At her feet was a footloose man
No, you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
[F#]
But if you try sometime
[A/C#]
You'll find
[E]
You get what you need

[E]                     [Aadd9/C#]
And I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't we're gonna blow a fiftyamp fuse"
Sing it babe

[E]                           [Aadd9/C#]
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mister Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mister Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead"
I said to him

In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well I could tell by her bloodstained hands
