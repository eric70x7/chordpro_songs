{sop: Verse 1}
[G5]
We all came out to Montreux,
[F5] [G5]
On the lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
[F5] [G5]
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa an the Mothers,
[F5] [G5]
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun,
[F5] [G5]
Burned the place to the ground
{eop}

{soc}
[C5] [G#5]
Smoke on the water,
[G5]
And fire in the sky
[C5] [G#5] [G5]
Smoke on the water
{eoc}

{sop: Verse 2}
[G5]
It burned down the gambling house,
[F5] [G5]
it died with an awful sound
A Funky Claude was running in and out,
[F5] [G5]
Pulling kinds on the ground
When it all was over,
[F5]
We had to find another place
[G5]
Swiss time was running out
[F5] [G5]
It seemed that we would lose the race
{eop}

{soc}
[C5] [G#5]
Smoke on the water,
[G5]
and fire in the sky
[C5] [G#5] [G5]
Smoke on the water

{sop: Verse 3}
[G5]
We ended up at the Grand hotel
[F5] [G5]
It was empty, cold and dead
But with the Rolling truck Stones staying just outside,
[F5] [G5]
ha, making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds,
[F5] [G5]
we made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this,
[F5] [G5]
I know, I know we'll never forget
{eop}

{soc}
[C5] [G#5]
Smoke on the water,
