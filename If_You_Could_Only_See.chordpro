[Am]                 [C/G]
If you could only see the way she loves me
[G5]      [G/F]
Then maybe you would understand
[G5]      [Am]              [C/G]
Why I feel this way about our love
[G5] [G/F]
And what I must do
[G5]    [Am]                 [C/G]                    [G5] [G/F]
If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

[Am]
Well you got your reasons
[Cmaj7/F]                     [Dadd11]
And you got your lies
[Am]
And you got your manipulations
[Cmaj7/F]                        [Dadd11]
They cut me down to size

[Am]
Seems the road less traveled
[Cmaj7/F]                     [Dadd11]
Show's happiness unraveled
[Am]
And you got to take a little dirt
[Cmaj7/F]
To keep what you love
[Dadd11]
That's what you gotta do

You're stretching out your arms to something that's just not there
[Am]                         [Cmaj7]
Sayin' you love where you stand

Give your heart when you can
