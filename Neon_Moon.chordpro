{c:Verse 1} When the sun goes down on my side of town
{c:Verse 2} And there's a rundown bar across the railroad tracks
{c:Chorus} If you lose your one and only
{c:Verse 3} I think of two young lovers running wild and free
{c:Verse 4} No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried
{c:Chorus} Oh, if you lose your one and only
{c:Solo}
{c:Verse 5} The jukebox plays on drink by drink
{c:Chorus} Oh, if you lose your one and only

{sop: Verse 1}
[Dsus2]
When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feeling comes to my door
[G]                 [Dsus2]
And the whole world turns blue
{eop}

{sop: Verse 2}
[Dsus2]
And there's a rundown bar across the railroad tracks
I got a table for two, way in the back
[G]                          [Dsus2]
Where I sit alone and I think of losing you
[A]
I spend most every night
[Dsus2]
Beneath the light of a neon moon
{eop}

{soc}
[G]                   [A]
If you lose your one and only
[G]                   [A]
There's always room here for the lonely
[G]                          [A]
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
[Dsus2]
Of a neon moon
{eoc}

{sop: Verse 3}
[Dsus2]
I think of two young lovers running wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
[G]                           [Dsus2]
You in the shadows of that smokefilled room
{eop}

{sop: Verse 4}
[Dsus2]
No telling how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
[G]
Telling my poor heart
[Dsus2]
She'll come back someday
[A]                                          [Dsus2]
Oh, but I'll be alright as long as there's light from a neon moon
{eop}

{soc}
[G]                   [A]
Oh, if you lose your one and only
[G]                   [A]
There's always room here for the lonely
[G]                          [A]
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
[Dsus2]
Of a neon moon
{eoc}

{sop: Verse 5}
[Dsus2]
The jukebox plays on drink by drink
And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think
[G]
And this hurt inside of me
[Dsus2]
It ain't never gonna end
[A]
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
[Dsus2]
From a neon moon
{eop}

{soc}
[G]                   [A]
Oh, if you lose your one and only
[G]                   [A]
There's always room here for the lonely
[G]
To watch your broken dreams
[A]                     [Dsus2]
Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon
[A]
To watch your broken dreams
[Dsus2]
Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon
[A]
Oh, watch your broken dreams
[Dsus2]
Dance in and out of the beams of a neon moon
{eoc}

{sop: Fade Out}
