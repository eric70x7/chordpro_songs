{sop: Verse 1}
[Dm]
It was a Monday
A day like any other day
[C]
I left a small town
[Dm]
For the Apple in decay
It was my destiny
It's what we needed to do
[C]
They were telling me
[Dm]
I'm telling you
[C] [Bb] [Asus4] [A] [Dm]
I was inside looking outside
{eop}

{sop: Verse 2}
[C]
The millions of faces
[Dm]
But still I'm alone
Waiting, hours of waiting
[C]
Paying a penance
[Dm]
I was longing for home
