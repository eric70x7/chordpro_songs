Always, "No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding ring"

And said, "No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding vow"

{sop: Verse 3}
[A]
You see, I wanted her real bad and I was about to give in
Uh, that's when she started talking about true love, started talking about sin

She said, "No huggee, no kissee until you make me a wife"
