{sop: Verse 1}
[Em]
You're not shy, you get around
[C]
You want to fly, don't want your feet on the ground
[Am]
You stay up, you won't come down
[Em]
You want to live, you want to move to the sound
Got fire in your veins
[C]
Burning hot but you don't feel the pain
[Am]
Your desire is insane
[Em]
You can't stop until you do it again
But sometimes I wonder as I look in your eyes
[C]
Maybe you're thinking of some other guy
[Am]
But I know, yes I know, how to treat you right
[Em]
That's why you call me in the middle of the night

[Em]
You play tricks on my mind
[C]
You're everywhere but you're so hard to find
[Am]
You're not warm or sentimental
[Em]
You're so extreme, you can be so temperamental
But I'm not looking for a love that will last
[C]
I know what I need and I need it fast
[Am]
Yeah, there's one thing in common that we both share
[Em]
That's a need for each other anytime, anywhere
