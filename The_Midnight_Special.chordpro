{sop: Verse 1}
                                    [G7]                     [D]
Well, you wake up in the mornin', you hear the work bell ring
                                    [A7]                    [D]
And they march you to the table to see the same old thing
                                    [G7]                     [D]
Ain't no food upon the table, and no pork up in the pan
                                    [A7]                    [D]
But you better not complain, boy, you get in trouble with the man

                                     [A7]                    [D]
Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me
                                     [G7]                     [D]

Yonder come miss Rosie, how in the world did you know?
                                    [A7]                                      [D]
By the way she wears her apron, and the clothes she wore
                                    [G7]                           [D]
Umbrella on her shoulder, piece of paper in her hand
                                    [A7]                                          [D]
She come to see the gov'nor, she wants to free her man

If you're ever in Houston, well, you better do the right
                                    [A7]                                      [D]
You better not gamble, there, you better not fight, at all
                                    [G7]                                 [D]
Or the sheriff will grab you and the boys will bring you down
                                    [A7]
The next thing you know, boy, Oh! You're prison bound
