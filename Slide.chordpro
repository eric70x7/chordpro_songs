Could you whisper in my ear
The things you wanna feel?
[Csus2]
I'll give you anything
To feel it comin'
[Em7]
Do you wake up on your own

You live with all your faults

Don't you love the life you killed?
The priest is on the phone
[Csus2]
Your father hit the wall
Your ma disowned you
[Em7]
Don't suppose I'll ever know
[D5]
What it means to be a man
[Csus2]
Something I can't change
I'll live around it
