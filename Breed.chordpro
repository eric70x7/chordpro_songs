{sop: Verse 1}
[F#5]
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, care, care if it's old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind
Get away, get away, get away
Get away, away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, afraid, ghost

[D5]               [A5]     [C5]               [B5]
We could plant a house, we could build a tree

I don't even care, we could have all three
