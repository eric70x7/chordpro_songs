{sop: Verse 1}
[A]Leavin' [D]home, out on the [A]road
I've been down before
Ridin' along on this big ol' jet plane
I've been thinkin' about my home
But my love light seems so far away
[G]And I [D]feel like it's all been [A]done
Somebody's tryin' to make me stay
You know I've got to be movin' on
{eop}

{soc}
[G]Oh, big ol' jet [D]airliner[A]
Don't carry me too far away
Oh, big ol' jet airliner
'Cause it's here that I've got to stay
{eoc}

{sop: Verse 2}
[A]Goodbye to [D]all my friends at [A]home
Goodbye to people I've trusted
I've got to go out and make my way
I might get rich, you know, I might get busted
But my heart keeps calling me backwards
[G]As I get on the seven o [D]seven[A]
Ridin' high, I got tears in my eyes
[G]You know you got to go through [D]hell[A]
Before you get to heaven

{sop: Verse 3}
[A]Touchin' [D]down in New England [A]town
Feel the heat comin' down
I've got to keep on keepin' on
You know the big wheel keeps on spinnin' around
And I'm goin' with some hesitation
[G]You know that I can surely [D]see[A]
That I don't want to get caught up in any of that
[G]Funky shit goin' down in the [D]city[A]
