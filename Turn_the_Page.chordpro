{sop: Verse 1}
[Em]
On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
[D]
You can listen to the engine moanin' out his one note song
[A]
You'd think about the woman or the girl you knew the night [Em]before
But your thoughts will soon be wandrin' the way they always do
[D]
When you're ridin' sixteen hours there's nothin' much to do
[A]
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was [Em]through
{eop}

[D]Here I am [Em]On the road again
[D]There I am [Em]Up on the stage
[D]There I go [A]Playin' star again
[C]There [D]I go [Em]Turn the page
{eoc}

{sop: Verse 2}
[Em]
So you walk into this restaurant, all strung out from the road
[D]
And you feel the eyes upon you as you're shakin' off the cold
[A]
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to ex[Em]plode
[Em]
Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can
[D]
All the same old clich√©s, "Is it woman? Is it man?"
[A]
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make your [Em]stand
Make your stand

{soc}
[D]Here I am [Em]On the road again
[D]There I am [Em]Up on the stage
[D]There I go [A]Playin' star again
[C]There [D]I go [Em]Turn the page
{eoc}

{sop: Verse 3}
[Em]
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
[D]
Ev'ry ounce of energy, you try to give away
[A]
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you [Em]play
[Em]
Later in the evenin' as you lie awake in bed
[D]
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
[A]
You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememb'rin' what she [Em]said
What she said
{eop}
